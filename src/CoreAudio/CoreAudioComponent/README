This is a component that provides audio input / output on top of CoreAudio.framework in the form
of an AudioUnit (which is an AudioToolkit thing).

The component gets installed into /System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component.

It is reachable both as an AudioComponent (AudioComponentInstanceNew) and a Carbon Component (OpenAComponent).
